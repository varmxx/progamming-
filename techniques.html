            <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
               
                <p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to create more maintainable and flexible code by following established practices. Here are some popular design patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                   
                    <strong>Singleton Pattern:</strong> Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
                    <strong>Factory Method Pattern:</strong> Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
                    <strong>Observer Pattern:</strong> Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
                    <strong>Decorator Pattern:</strong> Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

            <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
               
                <p>Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient software development. They enable you to solve complex problems efficiently. Topics include:</p>
                <ul>
                  
                    <strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms like QuickSort and MergeSort are used to arrange data in a specific order efficiently.
                    <strong>Search Algorithms:</strong> Binary Search is an example of an algorithm used to find an item in a sorted list.
                    <strong>Data Structures:</strong> Lists, Trees, and Graphs provide efficient ways to organize and store data for different use cases.

            <h2>Concurrency and Parallelism</h2>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
               
                <p>Concurrency and parallelism are crucial for optimizing program performance on multi-core processors. Topics in this area include:</p>
                <ul>
                   
                    <strong>Thread Synchronization:</strong> Techniques to ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources without data corruption.
                    <strong>Parallel Programming Models:</strong> Utilizing multithreading and multiprocessing to execute tasks concurrently.
                    <strong>Concurrency Patterns:</strong> Patterns like Producer-Consumer and Reader-Writer help manage concurrent access to resources.
