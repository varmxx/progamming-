                    <h3>History and Background</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, was created by Brendan Eich and first released in 1995. It is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.</p>
                    <h3>Syntax and Core Features</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript has a C-style syntax and supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It is known for its use in web development, enabling client-side scripting for web browsers. It also has event-driven and asynchronous features.</p>
                    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is widely used for building dynamic and interactive web applications. It is a fundamental technology for front-end development and is often used with HTML and CSS to create modern web experiences.</p>
                    <h3>Examples of Advanced Projects</h3>
                    <p> Building single-page applications (SPAs) using frameworks like React and Angular.</p>
                    <p>Creating real-time web applications with Node.js for server-side scripting.</p>
                    <h3>Pros</h3>
